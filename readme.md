<h1>HTML5 input type range</h1>

<p>This is a solution when using the html5 input type="range" attribute. The html5 slider can be used as a partial/module in your project. I did some tests on iOS 8+ and android with positive results. It will work on mobile, tablets and desktop. The slider is accessible by keyboard.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It consists of a less file, html snippet and plain(vanilla) javascript</li>
<li>the number of input elements is flexible, all values will be gathered to do a single post to your backend</li>
<li>Minor changes in the css are needed to customize the layout to your needs (form layout). </li>
<li>It has a coloured progress(track)</li>
<li>This solution will support all modern browsers / IE10+ and has a uniform look</li>
<li>The fallback is input type=text, if a working fallback for older browsers is needed it must be added, this will be fixed later </li>
</ul>

<p>There is a range-slider-object.js added which can be instantiated as a new object </p>

<p>More details about how to use it will follow...</p>
