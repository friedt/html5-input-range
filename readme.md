<h1>HTML5 input type range</h1>

<p>This is a solution when using the html5 input type="range" attribute . The html5 slider can be used as a partial/module in your project. I did some tests on iOS 8+ and android with positive results. It will work on mobile, tablets and desktop.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It consists of a less file, html snippet and plain(vanilla) javascript</li>
<li>This solution will support all modern browsers / IE10+</li>
<li>If a working fallback for IE8/9 is needed it must be added</li>
</ul>

<p>More details about how to use it will follow...</p>
